A chemistry tutoring app that's cool and all.

In it's current state, it doesn't include any REALLY GOOD content and the integration with Firebase basically didn't exist because of the horrible WiFi at the hotel. The app's hard-coded to only have one unit, and since I'm unable to go to nationals, I've ended the development of the app here. Maybe I'll look at it and make the content better later on, but for now, the app has served its purpose.
