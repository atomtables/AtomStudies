A chemistry tutoring app that's cool and all.

In it's current state, it doesn't include any REALLY GOOD content and the integration with Firebase basically didn't exist because of the horrible WiFi at the hotel. The app's hard-coded to only have one unit, and since I'm unable to go to nationals, I've ended the development of the app here. Maybe I'll look at it and make the content better later on, but for now, the app has served its purpose.

Not that the UI sucks or anything, its just that all the content is linked to a single file that hardcodes all the fetcher functions (out of necessity). A lot of the codebase also assumes there's a single unit, for the sake of minimising complexity. I didn't have a ton of time to get a lot of Chemistry research done while ACTUALLY studying for my AP Chemistry class. The code could just be refactored to be more functional and less hardcoded, and this app does NOT reflect my common practices with codebases (ðŸ˜­).
